# thedone.work

I am a freelance web developer.

Finding prospective clients is hard.
Closing the deal is hard.
Time tracking and billing is like 2-3 different apps in addition to a task manager or basecamp.
Clients love basecamp and absolutely refuse to use any other type of task manager
Updating my website and social media with projects i've completed is somthing i almost never remember to do.

I want to solve those problems and others by building a bunch of extremely basic features that can be re-used in my own
ideas , possible future pivots, and on client projects;

This repository is not very much much more than the basic Laravel Jetstream scaffolding translated to bootstrap with JetStrap and includes Nicholas Widart's Laravel Modules.

An additional possible advantage is that 3rd partys may  use this in client
projects and / or contribute their own modules.

It is not the goal of this project to be a replacement for or provide any other popular framework or tool.
I'm just trying to scratch my own itch.
If you've got an itch in the same spot, feel free to give this a try.
